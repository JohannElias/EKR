# EKR
Stereo-Vision Robot with Thermal Imaging from Lego, Raspberry and a few 3dprinted parts :-)

I'll publish the Python code for the Raspberry Pi3, the Lego Digital Designer files as well as 
the 3D-constructions made with 123d-Designer and the corresponding stl-files.
Oh, yes, and the code for the EV3-Bricks (you need 2) - and some V-SLot 2020 Profiles :-)
